This project help you detect face mesh and object mesh with mediapipe and YOLOV8, can draw grid 3D for the detail and benmark the distance face such as Height face, Noise...
Why RealSense D455?Unlike standard RGB cameras, this project prioritizes the depth accuracy of the D455. The spatial evaluation $(X, Y, Z)$ is critical for applications requiring sub-centimeter precision in object reconstruction and biometric analysis.
